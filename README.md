## About me

Hi, I'm Mika Tan!

I'm attending the University of British Columbia as a First Year Bachelor of Science and Masters of Management student, with an intended major of Computer Science and Math.

I'm big into full-stack development, having solo-built web applications for large-scale international university fairs, like the **[Manila World University Fair](https://ismanilafair.com)**. 

I'm also an AI researcher at **Algoverse**, where I'm conducting research into high-norm activations in diffusion transformer models. 

Finally, I'm part of the Electrical and Software team at **Sustaingineering**, a UBC Design Team, where I'm working with Raspberry computers, microcontrollers, and sensors to build a Remote Monitoring System for a fully-sustainable home, called the SMRT Project. 

In my free time I enjoy reading and exercising!
